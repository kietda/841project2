This project is to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) feed-forward network style of artificial neural network classifier, with Back-Propagation plus Gradient Descent induction learning.  The project will include a Classified Set of feature vectors with more than 2 possible classes.  The Training Set will be a percentage of those vectors.  A single MLP will be constructed with one hidden layer and one multi-class output layer. Python is used to implement this project â€“ there is no visualization component to this project.
